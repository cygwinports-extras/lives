sdesc: "Video Editing System"
ldesc: "LiVES mixes realtime video performance and non-linear editing in 
one application. It will let you start editing and making video right 
away, without having to worry about formats, frame sizes, or framerates. 
It is a very flexible tool which can be used by both VJ's and video 
editors - mix and switch clips from the keyboard, trim and edit your 
clips, and bring them together using the multitrack timeline."
